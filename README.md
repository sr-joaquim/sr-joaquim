👴 Well, well, look who stumbled upon @sr-joaquim's little corner of the web! 🌐

👀 Back in my day, I was all about potatoes, but now I'm diving headfirst into the bleeding edge of web development! 🥔➡️💻

🌱 Currently mastering the art of React, Next.js, Astro, Vercel deployments, Vue, Nuxt.js, Remix, and Bun—making these computers dance like it's a fancy ball! 💃🚀

💻 Building a shiny new shed to house my web adventures—spuds just didn't cut it anymore! 🏠

💬 Let's collaborate on cutting-edge web projects and swap tales of code mastery over a virtual cup of tea! ☕👨‍💻

📫 You can reach me by carrier pigeon or through the wonders of email, whichever floats your boat. 🐦✉️

😄 Pronouns: None of that business back in my time. I have no idea! 👴

⚡ Fun fact: Once tried to upload a potato photo to GitHub. Turns out, they prefer code! 🥔➡️💾
